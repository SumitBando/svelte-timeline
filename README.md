# What
A Svelte Timeline component.
This is what is looks like:
![image info](https://github.com/SumitBando/svelte-timeline/raw/main/static/timeline-sample.png "Sample")

This component has dependency on Tailwind.
It also has dependency on FontAwesome, which it injects.
If time permits, will try to remove these dependencies.

Original Tailwind snippet was from: https://codepen.io/sheikh_ishaan/pen/oNWpgoK

# Use
## Install
```bash
npm i svelte-timeline
```

To use, pass an array of Event objects, which has at least a title.
```code
/**
 * @typedef {Object} Event
 * @property {string} title
 * @property {string} [date]
 * @property {string} [status]
 */
 ```

A date field, if passed, is shown.
Though it is used to display a sequence of timed events, the component has no understanding of time, you can pass arbitary string in the date field, or even omit it.

The 'status' field controls the color and associated icon displayed for an Event.
If the value is 'success', it is displayed a background of bg-green-500, with a fa-check-circle icon.

For 'error', it is displayed with a background of bg-red-500, with a fa-times-circle icon.

If a status field is not included, it is displayed with a background of bg-gray-300, with text color of text-gray-400, with a fa-exclamation-circle icon.

The above values are all props, and can be overridden.

If the optional prop 'heading' is passed, it is displayed at top.

In your route or component,
```
<script>
 import {Timeline} from 'svelte-timeline'
 const events = [
  {
   title: 'Step1',
   date: 'Dec 18, 2021',
   status: 'success'      
  },
  {
   title: 'Step2',
   status: 'error'
  },
  {
   title: 'Step3',
  }
 ]  
<script>

<Timeline {events} heading='Something'/>
```
